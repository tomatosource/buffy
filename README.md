# Buffy ‚ö∞Ô∏èüî™

## Purpose

To identify dead code in go programs. This includes unused exported functions/attrs so cannot be used on libs etc. This will be fixed soon.

## Installing

```
go get github.com/tomatosource/buffy
```

## Running

Go to the root of the application you want to find dead code in (currently has `"./..."` hardcoded in as path, will be fixed soon), and run `buffy`.

## Reading the output

Output will look something like

```
TBD when it works
```
